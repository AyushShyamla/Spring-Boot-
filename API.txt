API 

API stands for Application Programmable Interface.
API is a set of RULES and Protocols that enables computer software applications to communicate and exchange data and functionalities with each other.

How does it Work?
So, API architecture is usually explained in terms of client and server.
The Client sends an API request to the Application Server and the Application server
in return, server processes the Query and sends it back as an API response to the Client.

In simple terms, API acts as an intermediate between the end-user client and the application server. 

There are four different ways that APIs can work depending on when and why they were created.

1. SOAP APIs
2. RPC APIs
3. WebSocket APIs
4. REST APIs
