Spring Data JPA

What is ORM?
ORM stands for Object Relational Mapping.

ORM is a Programming Technique used to Map application domain model objects(Fields) to relational database Tables.

With the help of ORM, we don't have to write SQL queries.


What is JPA?
JPA stands for Java Persistence API.

In Java, ORM is achieved via JPA.

JPA is just a specification, not an Implementation.

JPA provides the platform to work directly with the Objects without creating SQL statements.


What is Hibernate?
Hibernate is Java based ORM tool that provides a framework to Map application domain object models directly to relational database tables and vice versa.

Hibernate is the implementation for JPA.

Internally Hibernate uses JDBC to communicate with the Database.


What is Spring Data JPA?
Spring Data JPA is just an abstraction layer on top of JPA.

It just reduces the amount of boilerplate to access the data layer for various persistence stores.

Spring Data JPA is not a JPA provider.

Spring Data JPA cannot work without a JPA provider.

Spring Data JPA Repository internally calls all the Methods provided by the JPA(Entity Manager, Typed Query, etc).


IN SPRING BOOT WE USE SPRING-BOOT-STATER-DATA-JPA DEPENDENCY TO WORK WITH SPRING DATA JPA.
